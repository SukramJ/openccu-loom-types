# openccu-loom-types — retired

The generated Pydantic models and enum catalogue that this package used to
publish now ship **inside
[`openccu-loom-client`](https://github.com/SukramJ/openccu-loom-client)**, as
`openccu_loom_client.wire`.

```python
# before
from openccu_loom_types.rest import DeviceSummary
from openccu_loom_types.enums import Interface

# now
from openccu_loom_client.wire.rest import DeviceSummary
from openccu_loom_client.wire.enums import Interface
```

Nothing about the wire contract changed. The modules are byte-for-byte the same
generated output, from the same daemon assets, by the same generators — they
just live in the package that consumes them.

## What to do

Nothing, if you depend on `openccu-loom-client`: it carries the bindings itself
and no longer requires this distribution.

If `openccu-loom-types` is still installed in an environment — Home Assistant
never uninstalls an abandoned requirement, so this is the common case —
upgrading to `0.6.0` removes the stale modules and pulls in the client that
holds the real ones. `0.6.0` ships no Python modules at all; it is metadata
and a dependency.

Leaving the old version installed is harmless rather than dangerous: the two
distributions own disjoint top-level packages, so an orphaned
`openccu_loom_types` is inert. Upgrading is cleanup, not a fix.

## Why

The split cost a release of its own for every daemon release. Since the
auto-tag landed on 2026-06-22, 154 daemon releases produced 84 releases here,
**84 of 84** out of a `feat: regenerate from openccu-loom …` commit — not one
carried a hand-written line — while 54 of 106 publications never reached a pin
in any consumer. No consumer ever imported the package directly.

A daemon release now opens a regeneration pull request in the client and stops
there: no version bump, no auto-merge, no tag.

## This repository

Kept for its history and so the distribution name stays owned. The modules,
the generators (`script/gen/`), the regeneration workflow and the
reproducibility guard all live in the client repository now.
