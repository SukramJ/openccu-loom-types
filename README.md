# openccu-loom-types

Generated Pydantic models + enum definitions for the openccu-loom
REST + WebSocket contract. Sister-repo to the
[openccu-loom daemon](https://github.com/SukramJ/openccu-loom);
publishable as `openccu-loom-types` on PyPI.

## What this package provides

- `openccu_loom_types.enums` — every enum from the daemon's
  `pkg/hmenum`. Each enum is a `str`-typed Python `Enum` whose values
  match the wire strings the CCU emits. Source of truth:
  `assets/schemas/enums.json` in the openccu-loom repo.
- `openccu_loom_types.rest` — Pydantic models for the REST surface.
  Generated from `assets/openapi.yaml` via `datamodel-code-generator`.
- `openccu_loom_types.ws` — Pydantic models for the WebSocket
  envelope + push payloads. Generated from the same OpenAPI document
  (the WS envelope schemas live in `components.schemas` per ADR-0020).

## Why this exists (asks.md C1 + C3)

Higher-level clients (`openccu-loom-client`, the future
homematicip_local refactor) need stable typed bindings against the
daemon. Without a published types package each consumer would
duplicate the model code and drift away from the daemon's wire
contract. This package is the single import every Python consumer
shares — version-pinned and CI-rebuilt on every openccu-loom release.

## Regeneration workflow

Set `OPENCCU_LOOM_REPO` to a local checkout of the daemon repo
(default: `../openccu-loom`):

```sh
# Step 1 — make sure the daemon repo's schema export is fresh:
make -C "$OPENCCU_LOOM_REPO" export-schemas

# Step 2 — regenerate this package's models:
make generate
```

The two-step split keeps the daemon repo authoritative; this package
never re-parses Go source.

### Tooling required

- Python >= 3.11
- `datamodel-code-generator` >= 0.25 (for REST + WS Pydantic models)

Install both with `pip install -e '.[dev]'`.

## Versioning & contract identity

The package version (`const.VERSION`) is independent of the daemon
version; the regeneration workflow bumps the patch number on every
daemon release. The daemon coupling is carried by two stamped
constants in `const.py` (written by `make generate` →
`scripts/stamp_const.py`):

- `SCHEMA_DIGEST` — canonical digest of the daemon's contract assets
  these types were generated from (definition: daemon ADR-0028).
  Clients compare it against `GET /api/v1/info`.`schema_digest` to
  verify exact type/daemon parity at connect time.
- `DAEMON_API_VERSION` — the daemon's `api_version` at generation
  time. Minor bumps add fields without breaking existing consumers;
  major bumps remove or rename payload fields, scopes, or
  capabilities — see ADR-0020 in the daemon repo.

Regeneration and release are automated end to end. The daemon's
release workflow fires a `repository_dispatch` (`daemon-release`) at
this repo, which drives this chain:

1. `regenerate-on-daemon-release` checks out the daemon at the released
   tag, regenerates all modules, stamps the constants, bumps the
   version, seeds a baseline changelog section, opens a PR from a
   `regen/daemon-<tag>` branch, and enables auto-merge.
2. `ci` runs on the PR: `Test` (the suite) and `Regen clean` (re-runs
   `make generate` against the branch's daemon tag and fails on any
   drift, so hand-edits to generated modules are caught).
3. Once the required checks are green the PR squash-merges;
   `tag-on-regen-merge` then pushes `v<version>`.
4. The tag triggers `release-on-tag` → GitHub Release →
   `python-publish` → PyPI.

Manual fallback: `workflow_dispatch` with the tag, or the local
two-step flow above.

### CI / release setup

The automation needs three one-time repository settings; without them
the chain stops after step 1:

- A **`RELEASE_PAT`** secret — a fine-grained PAT (or GitHub App token)
  with `contents: write` + `pull-requests: write`. The regen PR and the
  release tag are pushed with it, because a branch/PR/tag created via
  the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` does **not** trigger the downstream CI and
  release workflows (GitHub's recursive-workflow guard).
- **Branch protection** on `main` requiring the `Test` and
  `Regen clean` status checks — auto-merge waits on these.
- **Allow auto-merge** enabled in the repository settings.

## What this package does NOT contain

- HTTP / WebSocket transport — see `openccu-loom-client`
  (when published) for the higher-level client.
- Any business logic — types only.
- Async helpers — types are framework-neutral.

## Development

Parts of openccu-loom-types are developed with agentic AI assistance,
primarily [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code).
Submitted issues are likewise triaged and analysed with agentic help.
Every change is still reviewed by a human maintainer and must pass the
project's tests before it lands — the AI speeds up the work, it does
not replace the review gate.
